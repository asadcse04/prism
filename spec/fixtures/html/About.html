   : <h1>About Prism</h1> 
    <p>Prism is a tool for "crowdsourcing interpretation." The concept emerged from a decade-long conversation on categories of textual interpretation 
    which took place at the University of Virginia and elsewhere, and specifically from transparency mark-up games <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=
      http%3A%2F%2Fwww.scholarslab.org%2Fdigital-humanities%2Fcrowdsourcing-interpretation%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNGTXomsmdD9ABphhmIzKZA9R56mGQ">invented by
      Bethany Nowviskie</a> for her Media Studies students and her colleagues in <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fbooks.google.com%2Fbooks%2Fabout%2FSpecLab.html%3Fid%3DVPXCk396uPYC">
      SpecLab</a>: </p>

    <p>the original game involved shared, Xeroxed page images, transparent overlays, dry-erase markers, a common interpretive prompt, and a moment in which 
    somebody yelled ‘Stop!’ and the transparencies were stacked up for discussion.</p> 
    
    At SpecLab, Jerome McGann <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fdigitalhumanities.org%2Fcompanion%2Fview%3FdocId%3Dblackwell%2F9781405103213%2F9781405103213
      .xml%26chunk.id%3Dss1-3-4&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNEzunrc9zEf83KzWiujAvkr4QL5oA">further developed the concept</a>, which became known as "the ‘Patacritical Demon."<br>

    The Scholars’ Lab offered these ideas as inspiration for the first project to be undertaken by graduate student fellows of <a href="http://praxis.scholarslab.org/">the Praxis Program</a> 
    in its inaugural year. Our first task was to determine how to translate the physical exercise of marking a text into a digital one. We decided that we would 
    continue to employ a constrained interpretive vocabulary and limit the length of the text in order to stay true to the transparency game, during which 
    texts would be marked up fairly quickly--ideally in one session. Also, like the transparency exercise, the end goal of Prism is to produce 
    "aesthetic provocations," that is, visualizations which provoke further discussion. But because it is a digital project, Prism can integrate many 
    individual interpretations and create a wide range of visualizations while maintaining data integrity.<br>

    Prism expands upon current notions of crowdsourcing to allow for more meaningful interaction with "the crowd." Users interact subjectively with a text
    and contribute to a collective interpretive energy that has infinite possibilities beyond the highlighting exercise itself -- in research, in the classroom, 
    or in engaging and experimenting with larger data in the humanities (computational linguistics and text mining, for example).<br>

    <h1>The Praxis Program</h1>
    <p><a href="http://praxis.scholarslab.org/">The Praxis Program</a> is a 2011-12 pilot project of the <a href="http://www2.lib.virginia.edu/scholarslab/">
      Scholars' Lab</a> at the <a href="http://www.lib.virginia.edu/index.html">University of Virginia Library</a> in which six humanities graduate students 
    spend a year in a collaborative, hands-on, digital humanities apprenticeship. The Praxis Program’s goal is to better equip knowledge workers for emerging 
    faculty positions and alternative academic careers at a moment in which new questions can be asked and new systems built. Visit the Praxis Program 
    site to learn more about the program’s evolving curriculum, including bibliographies for each topic, and to hear directly from Praxis Fellows and Scholars’ Lab 
    faculty and staff as they blog about their experience.</p>

    <h1>The Scholars' Lab</h1>
    <p>The Scholars’ Lab was established in 2006 at the UVa Library as a site for innovation in the humanities and social sciences. The Scholars' Lab
    is a place where faculty and advanced students can explore digital resources, find expert help, and collaborate on innovative research projects.
    The SLab also hosts events, such as workshops, talks, and roundtables, and sponsors the Praxis Program and a prestigious graduate student fellowship
    in the digital humanities.</p>
