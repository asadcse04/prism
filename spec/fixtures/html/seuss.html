    <div class="prompt"><p>Look up! Just up there.  &#8593;  No, a little higher than the eraser. Yes! Those are the highlighting colors you can use as you mark this text.</p>
      <p>They'll change from document to document, but all Prism users will share a common set of colors and concepts. That's what allows us to merge your markings with others' &mdash; generating Prism's <i>spectra of similarity and difference</i>.</p>
      <p>We're only providing one kind of visualization now, but more are to come. (You'll see some of our ideas when you've finished highlighting the text and click "Submit.")</p>
      <p>That's right. Just down there. &#8595;</p>

<p>Welcome to the SANDBOX VERSION of Prism! You can ignore me and get started with color highlighting on the right.</p>
<p><i>Now, the Star-Belly Sneetches<br/>
  Had bellies with stars.<br/>
  The Plain-Belly Sneetches<br/>
  Had none upon thars.</i>
</p>
<p>You might wonder what you're doing here. The Prism sandbox is an area of the site that lets you experiment without needing a user account, or feeling as if your color-coding of the text should reflect particularly profound insights.</p>
<p><i>Those stars weren't so big. They were really so small<br/>
  You might think such a thing wouldn't matter at all.</i>
</p>
<p>In fact, we think Prism shouldn't require much anxiety on your part about markings and interpretive choices at all. It's not necessarily a tool for sensitive personal annotation, but rather for merging your reading of a given text with the readings of many other users.</p>
<p>That's what we call CROWDSOURCING INTERPRETATION. &larr; (I bet you marked this "don't understand.")</p>
  <p><i>When the Star-Belly children went out to play ball,<br/>
  Could a Plain Belly get in the game . . .? Not at all.<br/>
  You only could play if your bellies had stars<br/>
  And the Plain-Belly children had none upon thars.</i>
</p>
<p>Don't worry! You'll get it. Just play with the highlighting colors until you are happy with your reading of this text, and click "Submit" to see what happens.</p>
  <p><i>When the Star-Belly Sneetches had frankfurter roasts<br/>
  Or picnics or parties or marshmallow toasts,<br/>
  They never invited the Plain-Belly Sneetches.<br/>
  They left them out cold, in the dark of the beaches.<br/>
  They kept them away. Never let them come near.<br/>
  And that's how they treated them year after year.</i>
</p>
<p>That's sad. Prism is considerably more collaborative. It's the work of an interdisciplinary team of UVa humanities graduate students apprenticing with the Scholars' Lab, in something called the Praxis Program. You can learn more about us and Prism, our practicum project, by clicking "About" in the footer.</p>
<p>That's right. Just down there. &#8595;</p>
