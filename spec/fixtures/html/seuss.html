      <p>Sneetches, star-bellied and otherwise, visited by one Sylvester McMonkey McBean.</p>

  <p>Now, the Star-Belly Sneetches<br>
  Had bellies with stars.<br>
  The Plain-Belly Sneetches<br>
  Had none upon thars.<br>
  <br>
  Those stars weren’t so big. They were really so small<br>
  You might think such a thing wouldn’t matter at all.<br>
  <br>
  But, because they had stars, all the Star-Belly Sneetches<br>
  Would brag, “We’re the best kind of Sneetch on the beaches.”<br>
  With their snoots in the air, they would sniff and they’d snort<br>
  “We’ll have nothing to do with the Plain-Belly sort!”<br>
  And whenever they met some, when they were out walking,<br>
  They’d hike right on past them without even talking.<br>
  <br>
  When the Star-Belly children went out to play ball,<br>
  Could a Plain Belly get in the game…? Not at all.<br>
  You only could play if your bellies had stars<br>
  And the Plain-Belly children had none upon thars.<br>
  <br>
  When the Star-Belly Sneetches had frankfurter roasts<br>
  Or picnics or parties or marshmallow toasts,<br>
  They never invited the Plain-Belly Sneetches.<br>
  They left them out cold, in the dark of the beaches.<br>
  They kept them away. Never let them come near.<br>
  And that’s how they treated them year after year.<br>
