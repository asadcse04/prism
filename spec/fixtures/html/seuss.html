  <p>Now, the Star-Belly Sneetches<br/>
  Had bellies with stars.<br/>
  The Plain-Belly Sneetches<br/>
  Had none upon thars.
  </p>
  <p>Those stars weren't so big. They were really so small<br/>
  You might think such a thing wouldn't matter at all.
  </p>
  <p>But, because they had stars, all the Star-Belly Sneetches<br/>
  Would brag, "We're the best kind of Sneetch on the beaches."<br/>
  With their snoots in the air, they would sniff and they'd snort<br/>
  "We'll have nothing to do with the Plain-Belly sort!"<br/>
  And whenever they met some, when they were out walking,<br/>
  They'd hike right on past them without even talking.
  </p>
  <p>When the Star-Belly children went out to play ball,<br/>
  Could a Plain Belly get in the game . . .? Not at all.<br/>
  You only could play if your bellies had stars<br/>
  And the Plain-Belly children had none upon thars.
  </p>
  <p>When the Star-Belly Sneetches had frankfurter roasts<br/>
  Or picnics or parties or marshmallow toasts,<br/>
  They never invited the Plain-Belly Sneetches.<br/>
  They left them out cold, in the dark of the beaches.<br/>
  They kept them away. Never let them come near.<br/>
  And that's how they treated them year after year.
