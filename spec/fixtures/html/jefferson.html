  <p>This happened to be the family of Logan, who had long been distinguished as a friend of the whites. This 
unworthy return provoked his vengeance. He accordingly signalized himself in the war which ensued. In the autumn of the same year, 
  a decisive battle was fought at the mouth of the Great Kanhaway, between the collected forces of the Shawanees, Mingoes, and Delawares, 
  and a detachment of the Virginia militia. The Indians were defeated, and sued for peace. Logan however disdained to be seen among the 
suppliants. But, lest the sincerity of a treaty should be distrusted, from which so distinguished a chief 
absented himself, he sent by a messenger the following speech to be delivered to Lord Dunmore.</p> 
<p class="blockquote"> "I appeal to any white man to say, if ever he entered Logan's cabin hungry, and he gave him not 
meat; if ever he came cold and naked, and he clothed him not. During the course of the last long and 
bloody war, Logan remained idle in his cabin, an advocate for peace. Such was my love for the whites, 
that my countrymen pointed as they passed, and said, 'Logan is the friend of white men.' I had even 
thought to have lived with you, but for the injuries of one man. Col. Cresap, the last spring, in cold blood, 
and unprovoked, murdered all the relations of Logan, not sparing even my women and children. There 
runs not a drop of my blood in the veins of any living creature. This called on me for revenge. I have 
sought it: I have killed many: I have fully glutted my vengeance. For my country, I rejoice at the beams of 
peace. But do not harbour a thought that mine is the joy of fear. Logan never felt fear. He will not turn on 
his heel to save his life. Who is there to mourn for Logan? Not one."</p>
<p>Before we condemn the Indians of this continent as wanting genius, we must consider that letters   
have not yet been introduced among them. Were we to compare them in their present state with the 
Europeans North of the Alps, when the Roman arms and arts first crossed those mountains, the 
comparison would be unequal, because, at that time, those parts of Europe were swarming with numbers;
 because numbers produce emulation, and multiply the chances of improvement, and one improvement 
begets another. Yet I may safely ask, How many good poets, how many able mathematicians, how many 
great inventors in arts or sciences, had Europe North of the Alps then produced? And it was sixteen 
centuries after this before a Newton could be formed. I do not mean to deny, that there are varieties in the 
race of man, distinguished by their powers both of body and mind. I believe there are, as I see to be the 
case in the races of other animals. I only mean to suggest a doubt, whether the bulk and faculties of 
animals depend on the side of the Atlantic on which their food happens to grow, or which furnishes the 
elements of which they are compounded? Whether nature has enlisted herself as a Cis or Trans-Atlantic 
partisan? I am induced to suspect, there has been more eloquence than sound reasoning displayed in 
support of this theory; that it is one of those cases where the judgment has been seduced by a glowing pen: and whilst I render 
every tribute of honor and esteem to the celebrated Zoologist, who has added, and 
is still adding, so many precious things to the treasures of science, I must doubt whether in this instance 
he has not cherished error also, by lending her for a moment his vivid imagination and bewitching 
language.
