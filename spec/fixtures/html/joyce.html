Once upon a time and a very good time it was there was a moocow coming
down along the road and this moocow that was coming down along the road
met a nicens little boy named baby tuckoo...
<br> 
His father told him that story: his father looked at him through a
glass: he had a hairy face.
<br>
He was baby tuckoo. The moocow came down the road where Betty Byrne
lived: she sold lemon platt.
<br>
<blockquote>
<i>O, the wild rose blossoms <br>
  On the little green place.</i>
<br>
</blockquote>
He sang that song. That was his song.
<br>
<blockquote>
<i>O, the green wothe botheth.</i>
</blockquote>
<br>
When you wet the bed first it is warm then it gets cold. His mother put
on the oilsheet. That had the queer smell.
<br>
His mother had a nicer smell than his father. She played on the piano
the sailor's hornpipe for him to dance. He danced:
<br>
<blockquote>
<i>Tralala lala,<br>
Tralala tralaladdy,<br>
Tralala lala,<br>
Tralala lala.<br></i>
</blockquote>
<br>
Uncle Charles and Dante clapped. They were older than his father and
mother but uncle Charles was older than Dante.
<br>
Dante had two brushes in her press. The brush with the maroon velvet
back was for Michael Davitt and the brush with the green velvet back
was for Parnell. Dante gave him a cachou every time he brought her a
piece of tissue paper. 
<br>
The Vances lived in number seven. They had a different father and
mother. They were Eileen's father and mother. When they were grown up
he was going to marry Eileen. He hid under the table. His mother said:
<br>

--O, Stephen will apologize.
<br>

Dante said:
<br>

--O, if not, the eagles will come and pull out his eyes.--
<br>
<blockquote>
Pull out his eyes,<br>
Apologize,<br>
Apologize,<br>
Pull out his eyes.<br>
Apologize,<br>
Pull out his eyes,<br>
Pull out his eyes,<br>
Apologize.<br>
</blockquote>
