    prism_title: "About Prism"
    description_p1_html: 'Prism is a tool for "crowdsourcing interpretation." The concept emerged from a decade-long conversation on categories of textual interpretation 
    which took place at the University of Virginia and elsewhere, and specifically from transparency mark-up games <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=
      http%3A%2F%2Fwww.scholarslab.org%2Fdigital-humanities%2Fcrowdsourcing-interpretation%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNGTXomsmdD9ABphhmIzKZA9R56mGQ">implemented by
      Bethany Nowviskie</a> for her Media Studies students and her colleagues in <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fbooks.google.com%2Fbooks%2Fabout%2FSpecLab.html%3Fid%3DVPXCk396uPYC">
      SpecLab</a>: '
    description_p2: 'the original game involved shared, Xeroxed page images, transparent overlays, dry-erase markers, a common interpretive prompt, and a moment in which 
  somebody yelled ‘Stop!’ and the transparencies were stacked up for discussion.'
    description_p3_html: 'At SpecLab, Jerome McGann <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fdigitalhumanities.org%2Fcompanion%2Fview%3FdocId%3Dblackwell%2F9781405103213%2F9781405103213
      .xml%26chunk.id%3Dss1-3-4&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNEzunrc9zEf83KzWiujAvkr4QL5oA">further developed the concept</a>, which became known as "the 
    ‘Patacritical Demon."'
    description_p4_html: 'The Scholars’ Lab offered these ideas as inspiration for the first project to be undertaken by graduate student fellows of 
    <a href="http://praxis.scholarslab.org/">the Praxis Program</a> in its inaugural year. Our first task was to determine how to translate the physical exercise 
    of marking a text into a digital one. We decided that we would continue to employ a constrained interpretive vocabulary and limit the length of the text in
    order to stay true to the transparency game, during which texts would be marked up fairly quickly--ideally in one session. Also, like the transparency 
    exercise, the end goal of Prism is to produce "aesthetic provocations," that is, visualizations which provoke further discussion. But because it is a 
    digital project, Prism can integrate many individual interpretations and create a wide range of visualizations while maintaining data integrity.'
    description_p5: 'Prism expands upon current notions of crowdsourcing to allow for more meaningful interaction with "the crowd." Users interact subjectively with a text
    and contribute to a collective interpretive energy that has infinite possibilities beyond the highlighting exercise itself -- in research, in the classroom, 
    or in engaging and experimenting with larger data in the humanities (computational linguistics and text mining, for example).'
